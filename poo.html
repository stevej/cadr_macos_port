<p2>Notes on (my) confusion or discrepancies in MIT AI Memo 528</p2>

<p>
While writing a CADR emulator I ran into some issues and/or
discrepancies in the available documentation.  I've tried to list them
here.

<p>
<i>
[These are my conclusions; If you read them and disagree, <b>please</b> send me email and
set me straight.  I do not have a functional hardware description (i.e. verilog) yet, so
some things are assuptions based on quick scans of the schematics]
</i>

<p>
<ul>

<li>The description of the ALU mode selection using IR7 seems inverted.  IR7=0 should select
the 'logic' side of the ALU.  IR7=1 should select the "math" side.
<p>
<li>The modification of the rotation count due to "misc function 3", in 16 bit mode talks
about XOR of IR4 and LC1.  I think this is inverted, i.e. POS4 := NOT (IR4 XOR LC1)
<p>
<li>The modification of the dispatch address due to L2 map bits talks
about bits 14 & 15.  In fact the map bits select L2 bit 18 & 19.
<p>
<li>The modification of the dispatch address due to L2 map bits talks about
replacing bit 0.  In fact the l2 map result is or'd with the existing bit 0 (see msi 2F01)
<p>
<li>The PDL pointer, when used in PDL push, increments *before* the
write.  Conversely, the PDL pointer, when used in PDL pop, decrements
*after* the read.
<p>
<li>The SPC stack pointer, on a push, increments *before* the write.
Conversly, the SPC stack pointer, on a pop, increments *before* the
write.
<p>
<li>Here's an interesting quote: 
<pre>
		;NOTE THAT THE LC HARDWARE IGNORES THE LOW BIT
		;AND READS IT BACK AS ZERO IN HALFWORD MODE
</pre>
<p>
<li>It seems a page fault should be generated on a write access if the
read access bit is not set, even if the write access bit is set.
<p>
<li>If the "length of byte" field in a dispatch is zero, the mask is zero and no
bits contribute to the dispatch offset.
<p>
<li>The microcode uses the fact that the MD is valid (for one
additional cycle) with the result of a previous memory-read even when
a new memory read has been started. (so the memory read pipe must be modeled)
<p>
<li>The dispatch instruction is affected by the instruction pipeline.  Below some of the
cases are enumerated for clarity.
</ul>

First, let me quote from "lmdocs: popj.2", a document which I found illuminating.
<p>
<pre>
POPJ-AFTER-NEXT in combination with JUMP and DISPATCH			[CONTRL]

Dispatch	R	P	N	PC	SPC	NOP
		0	0	0	jump	pop	no
		0	0	1	jump	pop	yes
		0	1	0	jump	push	no
		0	1	1	jump	push	yes
		1	0	0	popj	pop	no
		1	0	1	popj	pop	yes
		1	1	0	popj	pop	no
		1	1	1	popj	pop	yes

Jump		R	P	N	PC	SPC	NOP
(cond		0	0	0	jump	pop	no
 satisfied)	0	0	1	jump	pop	yes
		0	1	0	jump	push	no
		0	1	1	jump	push	yes
		1	0	0	popj	pop	no
		1	0	1	popj	pop	yes
		1	1	0	iwrite
		1	1	1	iwrite

Jump with condition not satisfied is similar to ALU and BYTE instructions.

Possible mods to increase usefulness:
A dispatch-call or jump-call in combination with popj-after-next
should neither popj nor pushj but just jump.  If it's xct-next
the right thing happens.  If the next instruction is inhibited, well
that's OK.  However, if the next instruction is not inhibited,
and it's a CALL, normally (without the previous call) would be
like tail recursive, but here will end up with two return addresses
on pdl, however, the top one is the address of the place called
in the first instruction and the one under that is the original
return so that's right too.

<p3>Another Dispatch example - with CALL, enumerating cases</p3>

<pre>

001	(NOP)
002	(DISPATCH TRANSPORT READ-MEMORY-DATA) ;FOLLOW ALL INVZ
003    	(CALL FUNC)
004
005

<b>dispatch yields N=0,P=0,R=0</b>

- exec check-page-read jump		fetch 002/dispatch
- exec dispatch				fetch 003/call
   new pc <- dispatch address
- exec call w/n-bit			fetch new pc (dispatch address)
   spc[++spc-ptr] <- new pc+1
   new pc<- call address
- (nop - pipe flush)			fetch call address
- exec 1nd inst @ call address

The call pushes the dispatch address + 1 and the pipe stalls because
the call has the N bit set, followed by the 1st instruction at the
call address.
